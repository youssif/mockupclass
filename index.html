		<h3>Slow Down</h3>
		<p>
			At Vintage Heart, we believe a good cup of coffee partnered with a bit of witty banter makes the world spin a little slower. We're a locally owned coffee home and we want to make your day a little more enjoyable.
		</p>
		<h3>Third Space</h3>
		<p>
			Vintage Heart has free WiFi and copious amounts of plugs, so pull up a chair and get comfy. Our baristas are highly skilled, self-declared coffee nerds. They will also dominate you at Scrabble.
		</p>
		<h3>Local Coffee & Pastries</h3>
		<p>
			We are proud to brew the fair trade coffees and espresso from fellow locals Third Coast Roasting Company. Those guys are great. They never sleep and choose to wear entire outfits of denim.
		</p>
		<p>
			Russel's Bakery graces us with their fine pasteries and Red Rabbit Cooperative Bakery provides crave-worthy vegan donuts, muffins, and brownies. With house-made syrups, we've got your coffee fix covered.
